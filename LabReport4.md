## Steps followed for CLDQ competiton

## Step 4 :Logging into ieng6

I had set up the ssh key for logging into my ieng6 account so logging to my ieng6 account was fairly easy which I did by writing this piece of code
`ssh cs15lwi23awm@ieng6.ucsd.edu`


## Step 5: Cloning my fork of the repository from my GitHub account
I had set up the ssh key for my github account as well so I just copied it from github.com where I had my fork of the repository and wrote the command:
`git clone` in the terminal and then just pasted the copied github ssh key to complete the command as `git clone git@github.com:jasThakker/lab7.git`
and then pressed <enter> and then the cloning happened.
